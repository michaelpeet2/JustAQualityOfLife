So this has been in the works since we first released our mod in 2020. Yeah it's been a while, but first I would like to thank our new sprites Stab_Person who helped us inmprove some sprites.

As we are beginners the stuff is very rudamentary. We will not have a regular update schedule, but will try to uopdate every so often. 

We have rebuilt our mod from the ground up, so it will take a while before all the items are back in the mod. 

We also have many more exiting features planned.

v2.0.0.0

>2 new accesories (Re-added old items)

--> Ultimite Elblem
---> Crafted with a WarriorEmblem, RangerEmblem, SorcererEmblem, SummonerEmblem, AvengerEmblem, and DestroyerEmblem at a mithril anvil
----> Grants 15% incresed of every damage type
----> Grants 10% increased of every crit chance



-->Master Ankh Gear
---> Crafted with a Ankh shield and Master Ninja Gear at a mithril anvil
---->Has the effects of the Master Ninja Gear and the Ankh Shield
----> Has the bonus perk of negating fall damage







   Lastly we would like to thank all the kind people on the Tmodloader Discord. Additionally thank you the people on the Terraria forums and the Github.
